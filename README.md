# Fashion-Vision

## Project Description:
FashionVision is an advanced machine learning project focused on classifying images from the Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of 10 different categories of fashion items. This project demonstrates the application of various data science techniques, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optimization, to achieve high accuracy in image classification tasks.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a robust classifier that can accurately identify the category of fashion items in the Fashion MNIST dataset. This dataset is widely used as a benchmark in the machine learning community due to its complexity and diversity.

## Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset contains 70,000 28x28 grayscale images in 10 categories:
   1. T-shirt/top
   2. Trouser
   3. Pullover
   4. Dress
   5. Coat
   6. Sandal
   7. Shirt
   8. Sneaker
   9. Bag
   10. Ankle book
       
Each image is associated with a label indicating the category of the fashion item.

## Project Components

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Normalization:** The pixel values of the images are normalized to a range of 0 to 1 by dividing by 255. This step is crucial for ensuring that the model trains efficiently.
2. **Reshaping:** The images are reshaped to fit the input shape required by the neural network.

### Model Architecture
1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** A CNN is employed due to its excellent performance in image recognition tasks. The architecture includes:
   - **Convolutional Layers:** Extract features from the input images using various filters.
   - **Pooling Layers:** Reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps while retaining important information.
   - **Fully Connected Layers:** Combine the extracted features to predict the output classes.

2. **Activation Functions:** ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is used for the activation function to introduce non-linearity in the model.
3. **Dropout:** Dropout layers are used to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to zero during training.

### Training and Evaluation
1. **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy is used as the loss function to measure the performance of the classification model.
2. **Optimizer:** The Adam optimizer is utilized for its efficiency and adaptive learning rate capabilities.
3. **Metrics:** Accuracy is the primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the model.

The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set to monitor its performance and make necessary adjustments.

## Results
The trained model achieves a high level of accuracy on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying fashion items. The results are visualized using confusion matrices and classification reports to provide a detailed understanding of the model's performance.

## Conclusion
FashionVision showcases the application of CNNs in the field of image classification. The project highlights key data science techniques such as data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and evaluation. By following the detailed steps provided in this project, practitioners can gain insights into building and deploying image classification models for various applications.
